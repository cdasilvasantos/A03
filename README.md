Webstorm: To install Webstorm, go to https://www.jetbrains.com/student. After you go to this page, scroll down till you see the Apply Now button to apply for a license from jetbrains. There are several options to apply, using either your univeristy email credentials or using an official document such as a school id. You should receive an email shortly from Jetbrains, giving you access to download Webstorm and give you a temporary license you can use for almost a year. That's it!

Git: To install Git, go to https://git-scm.com/downloads. Depending on the device you are using, whether MAC or Windows, you will have different steps to continue. As I only did it on a MAC laptop, I will explain how to download Git on a MAC. When you click on the button that says DOWNLOAD FOR MAC, you are directed to another page that will give you several options for installing Git. I used the Homebrew option. When you click on Homebrew, you are directed to their site that gives you a script for you to copy and paste onto your Mac Terminal. Once the Terminal successfully runs the script you pasted and you've installed Homebrew, go back to this page: https://git-scm.com/download/mac. Once you're here, copy the script that is written underneath the Homebrew option and paste it into terminal. Once terminal successfully runs the script, you should be good to go!

Github: To create a Github account, go to https://github.com/join. You are going to be asked to type in a username (one that has not been used before), type in an email, and a password. Choose whether you want to receive updates through email, and then select Continue. You are going to be asked to verify your account by solving a puzzle. After verifying your account, Github will send you a code to your email that you will need to copy and paste into the Github page. Github then asks you 1. How many team members will be working with you? and 2. What specific features are you interested in using?. You now have a Github account!
